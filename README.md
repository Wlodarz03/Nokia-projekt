## LLM and Pydantic Models-Based Framework for BMad-like Workflows in Vibe Coding

This project aims to design and implement a python framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Pydantic models to streamline and automate BMad-like workflows within vibe coding environments. By integrating advanced LLM models and output validation, the framework will enhance the efficiency of coding tasks, reduce errors, and facilitate more intuitive interactions between developers and code. The system will be capable of interpreting high-level instructions, generating code snippets, and validating data integrity in real-time, enabling a more fluid development process.
